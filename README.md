## How to run project locally

1. Clone this repository
3. Copy `.env.example` file to `.env`(or rename it .env)
4. In the `root` directory of this project run `yarn` command to install all needed dependencies.
5. After dependencies has been installed run `yarn dev` command to run this project.
   Now both (Nuxt preview for Vue and Next preview for React) projects are running locally and you can start working on them. You should be able to find them at localhost:3001/examples and localhost:3002/examples.
6. If you need to run only one of them, you need to run a desired preview from its directory, so you need to go for Vue: `/apps/preview/nuxt` and for React: `/apps/preview/next`.
